#LoRa-Reciver

Tekes the samples from another LoRa-Sender (Repository in this GitHub) and sends via HTTP to a Google Sheets and Telegram. It has the option to send via MQTT as well. 
All sensible info is in the include/secrets.h file, but it's not upload here for obvious reasons. 
If want to use this code either create the same file whith your data or just add it on the main.h defines.
